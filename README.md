# Browser visits

**Node | JavaScript | Express**

## Task Instructions

Set up a mechanism to capture user-agent strings from visits to a website.

Step 1: We'd like to receive from you a URL we can browse to from a phone and another URL we can browse to which will list the user-agent strings of browsers that accessed the first URL, with a timestamp of the access.

Step 2: We'd like a brief summary of how you built the solution and how it works.

Notes & timeframe:
The technical approach and solution is entirely up to you. It doesn’t need to be a long-lasting system i.e. it can be as temporary as needed. We're most interested in the explanation of the solution you create. How you do this is up to you and we don’t expect you to spend more than half an hour or so on this.
